# SubProject1: Analysis and Pricing of Interest Rate Options: A Focus on LPR and SHIBOR-linked Caps and Floors

In the ever-evolving landscape of Chinese financial derivative markets, understanding the intricacies of interest rate options is paramount. This project endeavors to conduct an exhaustive analysis of interest rate models, specifically focusing on the pricing of interest rate options like caps and floors whose underpinnings are tied to benchmarks such as the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) and the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR).

To provide a comprehensive view, the models will be delineated into three distinct categories: the Black model, short-term interest rate models, and the Libor Market Model (often referred to as the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela or BGM model). Through this classification and the corresponding emprical analysis, the project aims to deliver a clear understanding of the methodologies and implications of each model in the context of modern interest rate derivatives.
